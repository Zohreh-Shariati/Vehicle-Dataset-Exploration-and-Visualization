# Automotive Dataset Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview
This project involved transforming and analyzing a comprehensive automotive dataset to uncover trends and insights related to vehicle pricing, performance, and efficiency. Using Python, I applied data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis techniques to enhance the dataset's quality and extract meaningful patterns.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas (Data cleaning and manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)
- Google Colab (Development environment)

## Key Features
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis by handling missing values and standardizing data formats.
- Engineered new features to enhance analysis, such as combined MPG metrics.
- Created visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to reveal relationships between variables like drivetrain type, vehicle size, and transmission.
- Generated summary statistics to quantify trends in pricing and performance across different vehicle categories.

## Outcome
Delivered actionable insights through a detailed report and collaborative presentation, enabling better understanding of automotive market dynamics and supporting strategic decisions in product positioning and market segmentation.
